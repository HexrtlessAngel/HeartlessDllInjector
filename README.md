# HeartlessDllInjector
A dll injector written by, well... me... lol

# Very simple just need to do this...
If the game/program you need to inject into is 32bit, use the "x86" version.
But! If it's 64 bit use the "x64" version.

# So now to the good part, to inject...
Add/Remove any of your dll(s) to the inject list.
Make sure the process you want to inject into is highlighted in the process list (list on the left side).
Inject that shit!
